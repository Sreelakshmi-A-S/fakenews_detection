# Fake News Detection 
Detecting Fake News using Python and ML
To build a model to accurately classify a piece of news as REAL or FAKE.

This advanced python project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news. Using sklearn, we build a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset. Then, we initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well our model fares.


## RESULT
Implemented a TfidfVectorizer, initialized a PassiveAggressiveClassifier, and fit the model.
Obtained an accuracy of 92.82% in magnitude.
